        <h2><strong> PIZZA </strong></h2>
        <h3> <b> INGREDIENTS <b> <h3>
        <ol>
        <li> 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon instant yeast </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon sugar  </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1 cup warm water </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3> Pizza Sauce: </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
        <li> Toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives) </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3><b> Instructions: </b></h3>
        <p>1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well. 2. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the warm water and olive oil. Stir with a spoon until the dough starts to come together. 
        3. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour. 4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Allow it to rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size. 5. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat. 
        6. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a floured surface and divide it into two equal portions, as this recipe makes two pizzas.
        7. Take one portion of the dough and roll it out into your desired pizza shape and thickness. Transfer it to a pizza peel or another baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 8. Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
        <br> 9. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and olives. 10. Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. 11. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. 12. Repeat the process with the second portion of dough to make the second pizza.

        Note: You can customize this recipe by adding different toppings or experimenting with different cheeses or sauces to suit your taste preferences.
